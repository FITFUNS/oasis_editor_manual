You can manage scenes by opening the scenes dialog.

You can open the scenes dialog by clicking the 'Scenes' menu option in the menu:

Or you can click the scene menu button in the top-left inside the 3D viewport:

![Scenes Viewport](/img/user-manual/scenes/managing-scenes/scenes-viewport.jpg)

This will open the scenes dialog:

You can click "ADD NEW SCENE" to create a new scene, click on a scene to open it, and click the buttons on the right of each scene to duplicate or delete the scene. You can also click the banner icon on the left to make it the first scene to load when publishing the app or exporting the project. Think of this as the first 'level' of your application.
