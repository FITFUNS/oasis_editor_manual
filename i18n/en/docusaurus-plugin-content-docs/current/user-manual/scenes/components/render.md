title: Render
---

The render component enables an entity to render primitive shapes or render assets.

The render component can be enabled or disabled using the toggle in the top-right of the component panel. When enabled, the mesh instance referenced by the component is added to the scene and rendered.

## Properties

| Property              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Type                  | The type of graphics object to render. Can be one of: <ul><li>Asset</li><li>Box</li><li>Capsule</li><li>Cone</li><li>Cylinder</li><li>Plane</li><li>Sphere</li></ul> |
| Asset                 | The render asset to render in this render component. Only applies when the type property is set to 'Asset'. Only a single render asset can be assigned to a render component. |
| Cast Shadows          | When enabled, the mesh instance rendered by this component casts shadows on other mesh instances in the scene. |
| Cast Lightmap Shadows | When enabled, the mesh instance rendered by this component casts shadows on the lightmap. |
| Receive Shadows       | When enabled, the mesh instance rendered by this component receives shadows cast by other mesh instances in the scene. |
| Static                | If the entity referencing this render component will never move, check this box to give the engine hints to perform certain optimizations. |
| Lightmapped           | When enabled, this component's mesh instance does not receive lighting from dynamic lights. Instead, it receives lighting generated by lightmap baking. |
| Custom AABB           | When enabled, a user-provided bounding box is used for visibility culling of the associated mesh instance. This is an optimization that allows specifying an overly large bounding box to avoid per-frame bounding box calculations based on bone positions for skinned characters. |
| Batch Group           | The batch group this component's mesh instance belongs to. |
| Layers                | The layers the mesh should belong to. |
| Materials             | The material assets used to render this component's mesh instance. Each material corresponds to the respective mesh instance. |

## Scripting Interface

You can control the render component's properties using a [script component][2]. The render component's scripting interface is [here][3].
