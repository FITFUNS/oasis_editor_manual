:::warning

The Model component is deprecated. It has been replaced by the [Render](/user-manual/scenes/components/render) component.

:::

The model component enables an entity to render primitive shapes or model assets.

The model component can be enabled or disabled using the toggle in the top-right of the component panel. When enabled, the model is added to the scene and rendered.

## Properties

| Property              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Type                  | The type of model to render. Can be one of: <ul><li>Asset</li><li>Box</li><li>Capsule</li><li>Cone</li><li>Cylinder</li><li>Plane</li><li>Sphere</li></ul> |
| Asset                 | The model asset rendered by this model component. Only applies to 'asset' type models. Only a single model can be rendered per model component. |
| Cast Shadows          | When enabled, the model rendered by this component casts shadows on other models in the scene. |
| Cast Lightmap Shadows | When enabled, the model rendered by this component casts shadows on the lightmap. |
| Receive Shadows       | When enabled, the model rendered by this component receives shadows cast by other models in the scene. |
| Static                | If the model will never move, check this box to give the engine hints to perform certain optimizations. |
| Lightmapped           | When enabled, this model does not receive lighting from dynamic lights. Instead, it receives lighting generated by lightmap baking. |
| Batch Group           | The batch group this model belongs to.  |
