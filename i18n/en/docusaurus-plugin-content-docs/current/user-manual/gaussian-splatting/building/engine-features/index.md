The OasisW Engine includes a powerful, high-performance renderer for Gaussian Splats. This section covers a number of topics related to the capabilities of this renderer.

## The GSplatComponent

The [GSplatComponent](https://manual.oasisserver.link/engine/classes/GSplatComponent.html) is what grants OasisW apps the ability to render 3D Gaussian Splats. To use it:

1. Create an Entity
2. Add a GSplatComponent to it
3. Set a GSplat Asset on the component
