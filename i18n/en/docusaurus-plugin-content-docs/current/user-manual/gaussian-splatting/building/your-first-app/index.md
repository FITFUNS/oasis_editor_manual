title: Your First Splat App
---

Welcome to building your first Gaussian splat application! This section provides step-by-step tutorials to create a simple application that loads a splat of a cute toy cat that users can orbit around, pan, and zoom.

## Using the OasisW Engine

We'll build this app using the OasisW Engine API directly for maximum control and flexibility:

### 🔧 Using the Engine API

**Best for:** Experienced JavaScript developers who want full control

- **What:** Direct OasisW Engine API usage with ES6 modules
- **Files:** `index.html` + `main.js`
- **Pros:** Maximum flexibility, full engine access, smallest footprint
- **Cons:** More code to write, requires engine knowledge
