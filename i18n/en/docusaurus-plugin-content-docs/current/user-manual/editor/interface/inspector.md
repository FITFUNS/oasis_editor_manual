## Inspector View Types Based on Selection

- **Entity/Component Inspector**: Edits entity and component properties.
- **Texture Inspector**: Edits texture-related properties.
- **Material Inspector**: Edits material properties.
- **Cubemap Inspector**: Edits cubemap properties.

## Changing Property Values

- Specify how entities behave by changing property values.  
  Example: Select the model to render in the Model component, set light colors, etc.

- Simple text or numeric properties can be adjusted using text fields or sliders.  
- Some cases require special input methods.  
  Example: When selecting assets, available assets in the Asset view are highlighted.

- Some values can be manipulated directly in the viewport.  
  Example: Translate, Rotate, and Scale values can be changed by dragging gizmos.

## Add Component

- You can add various components—such as 2D, 3D, Audio, Physics, and Script—to an Entity using the Add Component button at the bottom of the Inspector.
- Added components are applied to the scene immediately, and you can see the results in real time as you change their settings.
- Detailed descriptions and usage instructions for each component can be found in [Components](/user-manual/scenes/components).
