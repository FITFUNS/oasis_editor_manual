title: Project Settings
---

Project Settings control how your project runs and how the Editor behaves for your team. They include engine/runtime configuration (rendering, physics, input, network), asset import defaults, and Editor preferences. Some settings apply only to you (session or user-specific), while most affect all collaborators on the current branch.

## Opening Settings

Load the Settings into the [Inspector](/user-manual/editor/interface/inspector) by clicking the 'cog' icon on the [Toolbar](/user-manual/editor/interface/toolbar) or in the [Viewport](/user-manual/editor/interface/viewport).
