## Overview

The OasisW Editor is a visual editing tool which you use to create and edit the scenes and entities that make up your project.

* Runs in your browser, so it's available wherever you are.
* Uses the OasisW Engine to render your scene. What you see is what you get.
* Live editing means that you can iterate on your game, even while it's running.
* One button press to open your project in a new tab.
<!-- * [Real-time collaboration](/user-manual/editor/realtime-collaboration) of multiple users on a single project. -->
<!-- * [Version control](/user-manual/editor/version-control) to organize features into separate branches. -->

## Updates

The OasisW Editor is ever changing with each update bringing in new features and deprecating old ones. 
<!-- To keep up, project data may have to be migrated to accommodate such changes. For larger and more complicated changes, you may have to adjust your project manually to ensure it is [compatible](/user-manual/editor/engine-compatibility) with your current engine. -->

<!-- If you are having trouble applying these adjustments or notice unusual changes in your project, visit our [troubleshooting](/user-manual/editor/troubleshooting) page. -->

<!-- ## Customization

In rare cases you may wish to extend the functionality of the editor to add custom behavior for your particular workflow. This can be achieved by using our [Editor API](/user-manual/editor/editor-api). -->
