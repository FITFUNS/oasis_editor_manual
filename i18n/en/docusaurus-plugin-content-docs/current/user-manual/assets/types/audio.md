Audio assets are sound files that can be played using the [Sound Component][sound-component].

All audio formats supported by web browsers are supported in OasisW. No processing is performed on audio files during import.

Not all formats are supported in all browsers. Currently, the most widely supported format is [MP3][mp3].
