title: Template
---

A template (also called a prefab) is an asset that contains part of an entity hierarchy. It has a root entity and can have any number of child entities. Templates are reusable entities that can be instantiated dynamically at runtime or placed multiple times in a scene. When you change a template asset, all instances of that template change as well.
