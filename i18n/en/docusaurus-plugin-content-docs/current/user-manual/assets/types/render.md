The Render asset type in OasisW is an important component that defines the appearance of 3D models in a scene. It contains mesh data and materials that determine how objects are rendered in a 3D environment.

Render assets are primarily used for:

- Defining the shape and structure of 3D models.
- Applying materials to models.
