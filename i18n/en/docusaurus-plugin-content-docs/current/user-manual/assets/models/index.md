title: Importing 3D Models
---

3D models and animations are imported into OasisW by uploading scene files from [3D modeling applications][1] such as [Blender][2], 3D Studio Max, or Maya.

OasisW supports various formats including glTF binary (GLB), FBX, and more. We recommend using the GLB format for the best results.

When you upload one of these files, a source asset of type 'Model' is created, along with several target assets including a '[Template][7]' and 'Render' asset that contain the model hierarchy. You can add instances of the 'Template' in your game.
