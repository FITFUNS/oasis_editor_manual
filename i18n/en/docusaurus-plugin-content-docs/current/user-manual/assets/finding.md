## Where can I get 3D models/sound FX/music for OasisW?

Sometimes it's important to create your own unique assets, but sometimes creating completely custom assets is too expensive or time-consuming. So we've compiled a list of links and resources where you can get all types of free or paid assets.

## Asset Marketplaces
