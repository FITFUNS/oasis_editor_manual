Most video games you've played so far will have some form of physics. Players expect objects to fall under the influence of gravity. They expect objects to collide with each other instead of passing through. They expect sound when two objects collide. And so on.

Physics engines attempt to recreate what we understand about the natural world in an artificial game world. They attempt to animate objects in a realistic, predictable, and expected way.

OasisW provides a very powerful physics engine that can be used to achieve many effects. This section introduces concepts such as rigid bodies, collisions, forces, impulses, and raycasting.
