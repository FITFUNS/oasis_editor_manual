## Notes

### Entity Placement Order in 2D Screen
When adding server-related entities, they are created inside 2D Screen. In 2D Screen, entities higher in the hierarchy are rendered first, so **place entities you want to see first at the bottom**. Consider UI element display order when placing them.
